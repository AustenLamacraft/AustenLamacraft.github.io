<p>In the summer I agreed to give a talk to the <a href="http://camphysoc.co.uk">Cambridge University Physics Society</a> a.k.a. CUPS. I took the opportunity to talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardar–Parisi–Zhang_equation">Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation</a> – one of my current obsessions – but also to learn about some new presentation tools. For quite a few years I’ve used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)">Beamer</a> to create presentations in LaTeX. Presenting mathematics in PowerPoint or Keynote involves too much dragging around of little boxes, which really breaks up the workflow.</p>

<p>Things move on, however, and in recent years a number of browser-based options for rendering slides in HTML have appeared: things like <a href="https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy">Slidy</a> and <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a>, to name just two. I plumped for reveal.js just because it seemed popular and was easy to get going with (and because I was having a crazy term and there was less than a week to go). Also <a href="http://pandoc.org">pandoc</a>. You can see the result <a href="https://austenlamacraft.github.io/Talks/CUPS_KPZ/CUPS_KPZ.html">here</a>. I was pleased with how it turned out, and see myself making the transition to one of these tools in my conference presentations. I’d like to give the very impressive looking <a href="https://github.com/impress/impress.js">impress.js</a> a try, but perhaps that’s a bit <em>too</em> flash.</p>
