<p>My web pages are in serious need of an overhaul. In the past I’ve built my sites using <a href="https://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/">RapidWeaver</a>, but it was never particularly future proof: something always needed updating.</p>

<p>Now I’m switching to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, which I used for the first time over the summer. Relative to a WYSIWYG editor it’s a bit more work, but you feel like you know what’s going on under the bonnet. There’s a large ecosystem, lots of <a href="http://themes.jekyllrc.org">themes</a>, free hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. The ease of writing in Markdown and rendering mathematics with <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> is wonderful.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int f(x)\,dx</script>

<p>See?</p>

<p>It would be great to integrate this with <a href="https://symplectic.admin.cam.ac.uk">Symplectic</a> and / or <a href="http://orcid.org">ORCID</a> to get an automatically updated publication list. Let’s see.</p>
