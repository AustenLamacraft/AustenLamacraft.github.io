We've just had a paper published in Nature investigating the [global circulation patterns of seasonal influenza viruses](/papers/bedford-global-circulation/). This work represents a collaborative effort between myself, [Colin Russell](http://www.vet.cam.ac.uk/directory/russell) at Cambridge University, analysis partners [Philipe Lemey](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/lab-members/PhilippeLemey.html) and [Steven Riley](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.riley) and data collaborators from all five [WHO Influenza Collaborating Centers](http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/collaborating_centres/list/en/). Here, we analyze the largest dataset of seasonal influenza viruses compiled to date, representing ~9600 viruses from all four circulating influenza lineages sampled between 2000 and 2012. Circulation patterns of influenza A/H3N2 have been well characterized (see for example [Bedford et al. 2010](/papers/bedford-global-migration/) and [Lemey et al. 2014](/papers/lemey-air-travel/)), showing little regional persistence and a powerful source-sink dynamic in which viruses emerge from the East and Southeast Asian tropics and spread to the rest of the world, rapidly replacing endemic lineages. In this paper, we apply [phylogeographic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogeography) methods to show that the other three lineages of seasonal influenza, A/H1N1, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, are spreading throughout the world in a quite different fashion from H3N2.

We find that influenza B viruses in particular often remain endemic within a geographic region without spreading to other parts of the world. India and China still represent source populations from which influenza B viruses throughout the world descend, but this process occurs much more slowly in influenza B. Because geographic mixing is slower in influenza B than influenza H3N2, we observe  distinct genetic lineages of influenza B associated with different geographic regions. We quantify this difference by measuring the regional persistence of different viruses, finding that H3N2 viruses persist within a region an average of 6 months, while B viruses persist an average of 12 or 13 months. Influenza H1N1 shows up in between H3N2 and B, with an average regional persistence of 9 months.
