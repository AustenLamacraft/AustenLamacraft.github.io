We've just had a paper published in Nature investigating [global circulation patterns across seasonal influenza viruses](/papers/bedford-global-circulation/). This work represents a collaborative effort between myself, [Colin Russell](http://www.vet.cam.ac.uk/directory/russell) at Cambridge University, analysis partners [Philipe Lemey](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/lab-members/PhilippeLemey.html) and [Steven Riley](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.riley) and data collaborators from all five [WHO Influenza Collaborating Centers](http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/collaborating_centres/list/en/). Here, we analyze the largest dataset of seasonal influenza viruses compiled to date, representing ~9600 viruses from all four circulating influenza lineages sampled between 2000 and 2012. Circulation patterns of influenza A/H3N2 have been well characterized (see for example [Bedford et al. 2010](/papers/bedford-global-migration/) and [Lemey et al. 2014](/papers/lemey-air-travel/)), showing little regional persistence and a powerful source-sink dynamic in which viruses emerge from the East and Southeast Asian tropics and spread to the rest of the world, rapidly replacing endemic lineages. In this paper, we apply [phylogeographic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogeography) methods to show that the other three lineages of seasonal influenza, A/H1N1, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, are spreading throughout the world in a quite different fashion from H3N2. 

Influenza B viruses in particular evolve differently from influenza H3N2.

H3N2 shows rapid antigenic drift in which new variants consistently emerge and spread through the viral population. Because of this, people are re
