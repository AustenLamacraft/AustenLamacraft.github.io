About a week ago I gave an internet seminar on phylogenetics of the influenza virus over at [phyloseminar.org](http://phyloseminar.org).  I'm very happy someone stepped up to organize something like this (thanks Erick!).  You can watch me talk to my computer for an hour if you'd like, and the other seminars are really good as well.
