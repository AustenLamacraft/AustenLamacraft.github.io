Another [paper to share](/pdfs/rogers-qtzl-2010.pdf).  Here, I helped with the population genetic side of things in [Rebekah Roger's](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hartl/lab/people/rebekah.html) analysis of a new gene in <i>Drosophila</i>.  Before I left the Hartl lab, I worked with Rebekah on a bioinformatic analysis of <em>chimeric</em> genes.  These are strange accidents of evolution where two functioning genes are spliced together to create a new gene with bits from both parental genes.  We found 14 such genes in <i>Drosophila</i>, one of which is the focus of this current work.  This new gene, which we're calling <i>Quetzalcoatl</i>, appears to be fantastic for the flies that possess it.

From my perspective, it's good to see the bioinformatic work pay dividends.
