Another [paper to share](/papers/rogers-2010-adaptive/).  Here, I helped with the population genetic side of things in [Rebekah Roger's](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hartl/lab/people/rebekah.html) analysis of a new gene in *Drosophila*.  Before I left the Hartl lab, I worked with Rebekah on a bioinformatic analysis of *chimeric* genes.  These are strange accidents of evolution where two functioning genes are spliced together to create a new gene with bits from both parental genes.  We found 14 such genes in *Drosophila*, one of which is the focus of this current work.  This new gene, which we're calling *Quetzalcoatl*, appears to be fantastic for the flies that possess it.

From my perspective, it's good to see the bioinformatic work pay dividends.
