[Gytis Dudas's](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/people/gdudas/) paper on ["Reassortment between influenza B lineages and the emergence of a co-adapted PB1-PB2-HA gene complex"](/papers/dudas-flub-reassortment/) has just been published in Molecular Biology and Evolution.  I'm very proud of the open science effort here.  We've had this paper up on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1094) since March and have [tracked reviews and our responses publicly on GitHub](https://github.com/evogytis/fluB/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).  Gytis has also supplied all [data](https://github.com/evogytis/fluB/tree/master/data) and [scripts](https://github.com/evogytis/fluB/tree/master/scripts) to run the analysis and generate figures in the GitHub repository.
