We've just had a paper published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution on ["Simultaneously estimating evolutionary history and repeated traits phylogenetic signal"](/papers/vrancken-phylogenetic-signal/).  This work, lead by [Bram Vrancken](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/lab-members/BramVrancken.html), [Philippe Lemey](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/lab-members/PhilippeLemey.html) and [Marc Suchard](http://faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/msuchard/), estimates *phylogenetic signal* in a fully Bayesian fashion, integrating over uncertainty in evolutionary history.  This method provides an estimate of the extent to which variance of a continuous trait (like viral load) can be explained by evolutionary relatedness and thus gives an estimate of the trait's [heritability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability).
