# Belief Propagation _vs._ Normalizing Flows

This note explores the possible connection between these two approaches.

## Belief Propagation

[Belief Propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_propagation) is an algorithm for computing the marginal distribution of variables in a

Belief propagation was introduced to computer science in 1982 by Judea Pearl. However, the same method already existed in physics and is known as the __Bethe--Peierls__ approximation.




## Normalizing Flows

It would seem that one of the obvious differences is that while BP computes a _marginal_ distribution on a subset of the variables, normalizing flows construct the full distribution
