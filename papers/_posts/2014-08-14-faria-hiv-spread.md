# Abstract

Thirty years after the isolation of pandemic HIV-1 group M, the virusâ€™ place of origin, early dissemination and its establishment throughout Africa still remain unclear. Using statistical phylodynamic approaches applied to large collections of sequence data from central Africa, we show that Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), was the focus of early group M transmission and the source of pre-1960 pandemic viruses in Brazzaville and southern DRC locations. Location and dating estimates of group M pandemic were validated using the earliest archival sample of HIV-1, also from Kinshasa. Comparison of the epidemic histories of group M and the non-pandemic group O shows similar patterns until ~1960, after which group M undergoes accelerated epidemic growth that significantly outpaces human population growth in the region. Our results provide a detailed reconstruction of the early spatial and population dynamics of HIV-1, and emphasize the role of social changes during the establishment of blood-borne viruses in human populations.
