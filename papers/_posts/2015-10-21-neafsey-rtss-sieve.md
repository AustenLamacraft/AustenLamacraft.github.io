# Abstract

**Background:** The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine targets the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium falciparum and confers partial protective efficacy against clinical and severe malaria disease in infants and children for 12 months post vaccination (NCT00866619). We investigated whether vaccine efficacy was specific to parasite genotypes at CS.

**Methods:** We employed PCR-based next-generation sequencing of DNA extracted from 4985 participant samples to survey polymorphisms in CS. We evaluated the impact of polymorphic CS positions and several haplotypic regions on vaccine efficacy (VE) against first or only episodes of clinical malaria within a year of vaccination.

**Results:** VE was significantly greater against clinical malaria with infections matching the vaccine strain in several haplotype regions and individual amino acid positions of the CS C-terminus in the 5-17 month old per-protocol category of 4557 RTS,S/AS01 vaccinated and 2328 control vaccinated participants. For matched versus mismatched malaria based on the entire CS C-terminus, 1-year cumulative VE after vaccination was 50.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.6 to 62.3) versus 33.4% (95% CI, 29.3 to 37.2), P = 0.04 for differential VE; and VE based on a hazard ratio was 62.7% (95% CI, 51.6 to 71.3) versus 54.2% (95% CI, 49.9 to 58.1), P = 0.06. In the 6-12 week old category, VE against matched and mismatched malaria was similar.

**Conclusions:** Given the low frequency of parasites matching the vaccine strain at many of the study sites, these results suggest that parasite genotype contributes to the partial nature of protection conferred by RTS,S/AS01 vaccination in 5-17 month old children.
