# Abstract

Understanding the spatio-temporal patterns of emergence and circulation of new human seasonal influenza virus variants is a key scientific and public health challenge. The global circulation patterns of influenza A/H3N2 viruses are well-characterized but the patterns of A/H1N1 and B viruses have been largely unexplored. Here we show based on analyses of 9,604 hemagglutinin sequences of human seasonal influenza viruses from 2000-2012 that the global circulation patterns of A/H1N1 (up to 2009), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses differ substantially from those of A/H3N2 viruses. While genetic variants of A/H3N2 viruses did not persist locally between epidemics and were reseeded from East and Southeast (E-SE) Asia each year, genetic variants of A/H1N1 and B viruses persisted across multiple seasons and exhibited complex global dynamics with E-SE Asia playing a limited role in disseminating new variants. Epidemiological modeling suggests that the slower evolution of A/H1N1 and B viruses decreases average ages of infection, epidemic size and frequency, and rates of global movement of viruses. These findings suggest that subtle differences in viral evolution are driving large-scale epidemiological behavior.
