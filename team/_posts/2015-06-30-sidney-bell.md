I am a graduate student at the University of Washington, where I am pursuing a joint MS in Epidemiology (advised by Trevor Bedford) and a PhD in Molecular and Cell Biology (advised by Michael Emerman). Generally, I am interested in questions about how viruses evolve and interact with their hosts. What allows a virus to infect a new host species? How do viruses spread through a population? How do strains change and evolve over the course of an epidemic? Over evolutionary time?

Originally from Salt Lake City, I received my bachelor's in Biochemistry from Vassar College. As an undergraduate, I worked on bacterial lipidomics and pathogenicity with Teresa Garret at Vassar College, and on molecular genetics with Mario Capecchi at the University of Utah.
