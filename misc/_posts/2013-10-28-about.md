This site is a fork of the wonderful [bedford.io](http://bedford.io) by Trevor Bedford. Trevor's site is a true exemplar of open science, with ongoing research described on project pages, each with their own GitHub repo. I'm not at that point yet, but it's certainly an aspiration.

I've made a few changes, mostly cosmetic at the moment. The code is available [here](https://github.com/AustenLamacraft/notebook)
